%Objective
\mysection{Student Objective}
In this assignment, you will develop two implementations of a Priority Queue: one ordered and one unordered.
Both implementations must adhere to specific criteria, ensuring removal operations consistently return the object
of the highest priority that has been in the queue the longest. Additionally, the FIFO order must be maintained
within each priority level.
\\[2mm]
This assignment will progress through three distinct phases. Phase 1 involves the implementation of two Array classes:
\verb|UnorderedArrayList| and \verb|OrderedArrayList|. Following Phase 1, Phase 2 focuses on the development of a Priority Queue
specific to each array class type. Finally, Phase 3 will entail conducting an analysis of your written code, evaluating aspects
such as time complexity, space complexity, and overall clarity.
\\[2mm]
As you tackle this first program, remember it's your chance to grasp the basics of testing, finding edge cases, and mastering debugging.
Embrace the opportunity to learn test-driven developmentâ€”it's the perfect starting point for your journey in this course!

\mysection{Phase 2 Instructions}
You should have already read \emph{Separate Compilation}. If you skip this step, you may struggle to understand how the program files work together.
\\[2mm]
Class prototypes defined in \verb|UnorderedPQ.h| and \verb|OrderedPQ.h| are provided. Both of these classes are subclasses
of the pure virtual \verb|PriorityQueue| class. You \textbf{must} review \verb|PriorityQueue.h| for reference to understand the functionality of
each method. 
\\[2mm]
Phase 2 of the project will consist of the following files \emph{in addition to phase 1 files}. You must use exactly these filenames.
\\

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\hspace{1cm}\begin{tabular}{@{} ll @{}}
    \verb|PriorityQueue.h| & The PQ ADT interface. (provided)\\
    \verb|OrderedPQ.h| & The ordered PQ definition. (provided)\\
    \verb|UnorderedPQ.h| & The unordered PQ definition. (provided)\\
    \verb|OrderedPQ.cpp| & The ordered array implementation. \\
    \verb|UnorderedPQ.cpp| & The unordered array implementation.\\
\end{tabular}
\\[4mm]
Your task is to write your own code for the public functions found in \verb|OrderedPQ.h| and \verb|UnorderedPQ.h|. You may not
modify \verb|PriorityQueue.h|.
\\[4mm]
Finally, this phase marks the culmination of the coding aspect of the project. Ensure that your code is thoroughly commented,
well-formatted according to C++ standards, and adheres to best practices such as meaningful variable names and using camelCase.
\newpage\noindent
\mysection{Additional Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You may not modify any ADT interface.
    \item You may add private members as needed.
    \item You may add public functions strictly for debugging purposes. These must be removed before submitting.
    \item You may only submit source files specified in the instructions.
    \item All source code file must have your \textbf{name} and \textbf{RedID} at the beginning of the file.
    \item Each method must be as efficient as possible.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example: $O(N)$ complexity is unacceptable if the method could be written with $O(\log N)$ complexity.
        \item Hint: For the ordered array, certain methods must use binary search where possible.
    \end{itemize}
    \item By convention, a lower number means a higher priority.
    \item Your implementations may only \verb|#include| the following files/libraries: \verb|"OrderedArrayList.h"|, \verb|"UnorderedArrayList.h"|,
    and \verb|<stdexcept>|. \verb|<iostream>| may be used for debugging purposes but should be removed before submitting.
    \item You are expected to write all the code yourself, you may not use the Standard Library API for any containers.
    \item Your code must not print anything.
    \item Your code should handle all error conditions gracefully. It should never crash.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Follow the outline in the ADT interface which specify what exceptions to throw.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Your code must compile and run correctly on Gradescope to receive any credit. Testing on edoras may prove to be a helpful exercise.
    \item Minimal tester/driver programs may be provided to help you test your code. You should add more tests and focus heavily on the edge cases.
    \item Allow sufficient time for testing on Gradescope.
\end{itemize}

\mysection{Hints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The implementation for \verb|UnorderedPQ| and \verb|OrderedPQ| should be done by calling methods from the phase 1 ArrayList classes you implemented.
    If you are rewriting the same/similar code from phase 1 then you're on the wrong track. Focus on how to use phase 1 objects to implement phase 2 functions
    with very little new code.
    \item If you are getting unexpected output, use \verb|gdb| and step through your program. Failure to learn how to use debugging tools will result in many
    wasted hours.
\end{itemize}

\mysection{Turning in Phase 2}
To submit phase 2, you must upload the following C++ files to your \verb|Gradescope| account through Canvas. The automated grading platform will run.
You're permitted unlimited submissions, but \emph{don't} use Gradescope as your testing platform. If we see this happening, we will enforce limited submissions.

\mysection{Cheating Policy}
There is a zero tolerance policy on cheating in this course. You are expected to complete all programming assignments on your own.
Collaboration with other students in the course is not permitted. You may discuss ideas or solutions in general terms with other students,
but you must not exchange code. During the grading process I will examine your code carefully. Anyone caught cheating on a programming
assignment (or on an exam) will receive an "F" in the course, and a referral to Judicial Procedures.
