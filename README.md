## Phases

### Phase 1 Instructions
Please refer to the instructions provided in the "[Phase-1-Instructions.pdf](phase-1/instructions/Phase-1-Instructions.pdf)" file for phase 1 of the assignment. It covers the implementation of two Array classes: `UnorderedArrayList` and `OrderedArrayList`.

### Phase 2 Instructions
For phase 2 instructions, see the "[Phase-2-Instructions.pdf](phase-2/instructions/Phase-2-Instructions.pdf)" file. This phase focuses on the development of Priority Queues specific to each array class type.

### Phase 3 Instructions
The instructions for phase 3 can be found in the "[Phase-3-Instructions.pdf](phase-3/instructions/Phase-3-Instructions.pdf)" file. This phase involves conducting an analysis of the written code, evaluating aspects such as time complexity, space complexity, and overall clarity.
